# BFG for Windows

This repository contains a build script that compiles version 1.12.5 of the
[BFG Repo Cleaner](https://github.com/rtyley/bfg-repo-cleaner) using IKVM.NET.
Once this is done, BFG can run on Windows without needing to have the
notoriously insecure Java runtime installed.

The BFG Repo Cleaner is licensed under the GNU General Public License,
version 3 or (at your option) any later version.
