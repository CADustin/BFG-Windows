# BFG for Windows

This repository contains a build script that downloads version 1.12.5 of the
[BFG Repo Cleaner](https://github.com/rtyley/bfg-repo-cleaner), and a small
application that launches it. Note that you will need Java installed for
this program to work. (Version 1.7 is required, version 1.8 is preferred.
This program does not currently detect anything newer than 1.8.)
